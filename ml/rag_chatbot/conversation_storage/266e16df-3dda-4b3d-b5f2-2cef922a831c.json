      "content": "Based on current Indian financial regulations, Peer-to-peer lending platforms in India must maintain escrow accounts with scheduled commercial banks for investor protection. Individual borrowers have a maximum exposure limit of ₹50,000 across all P2P platforms combined. Platform operators must maintain a minimum net worth of ₹2 crore to ensure operational stability. These regulations balance innovation with investor protection in the growing P2P sector. Would you like me to explain the process or requirements in more detail?",

      "content": "Here's what you should know: Here's how P2P lending works in detail:\n\n1. **Registration Process**: Both lenders and borrowers must register on SEBI-registered P2P platforms with KYC documentation.\n\n2. **Risk Assessment**: Platforms conduct credit scoring and risk assessment for borrowers using algorithms and credit bureau data.\n\n3. **Loan Listing**: Borrowers create loan requests with purpose, amount (max ₹10 lakhs), and proposed interest rates.\n\n4. **Matching**: Lenders browse loan requests and choose to fund partially or fully based on risk appetite.\n\n5. **Documentation**: Legal loan agreements are created automatically by the platform.\n\n6. **Fund Transfer**: Money flows through escrow accounts maintained with scheduled commercial banks.\n\n7. **Repayment**: Borrowers repay through EMIs, and platforms handle collection and distribution to lenders.\n\n8. **Default Handling**: Platforms have recovery mechanisms, but lenders bear the credit risk.
